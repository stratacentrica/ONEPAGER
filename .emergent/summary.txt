The previous AI engineer initiated the development of the ONEderpage landing page builder, later rebranded to APEXONE HIT ONE PAGER. The process was highly iterative, driven by frequent user feedback, often in the form of bug reports and feature requests. The engineer started by scaffolding the core React/FastAPI application, implementing a glass-morphism UI, and adding basic components (Text, Button, Form, Timer, Audio, Video, Logo). Significant effort was spent on addressing usability issues, especially with drag-and-drop functionality, component properties, and layering. Key features like FTP upload, various export formats (HTML, JSON, Embed), background image effects (fade, blur, invert, vignette), dynamic shimmer, diverse CTA buttons, a gamified slot machine, and a cutting-edge visitor data capture system were progressively added and refined. The trajectory showcases a strong focus on UI aesthetics, a rapid development cycle, and a diligent approach to fixing reported bugs, ultimately concluding with a declaration of 100% functional components.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a slick landing page builder called ONEderpage, later rebranded to APEXONE HIT ONE PAGER. The core vision was a tool that breaks corporate cool with clean, minimal curves, classy shadows, and proper colors/tones, outputting single-page HTML files and embed codes, with a backend FTP upload option.

Key features include:
- **Design & UI**: Beautiful, fit-to-screen backgrounds (with options for fade, blur, invert, vignette), glass transparent windows, optional colors and curvature, theme switch, dynamic shimmer effect.
- **Content Elements**: Optional data extraction forms, announcements, timers/countdowns, sound integration (royalty-free atmospheric tracks, user upload), logo placement, view counter, video inclusion, podcast play.
- **Interactive Elements**: Call direct, schedule a call, Request Call, Join Now, Subscribe, Join Waitlist, Email Me, Take Photo (with camera permission), ElevenLabs AI bot widget, and free chatbot providers (Tidio, Crisp, Tawk.to, Zendesk, Intercom).
- **Unique Features**: Gamified slot machine with configurable win rates and prizes, visitor data capture (IP, location, device) with a security showcase UI.
- **Output & Deployment**: One-page easy-to-upload files, embed code (Hostinger, HTML, iFrame, JSON), downloadable files, and direct FTP upload (e.g., to HostGator).
- **Quality Assurance**: Never allow overcrowding or poor layout, adhere to modern corporate design rules, and ensure high functionality.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture:



**Detailed Directory Structure:**


**Key Files and Their Importance:**

-   **/app/backend/server.py**:
    -   **Summary**: The core FastAPI backend responsible for handling API requests, managing data (likely storing page configurations or component data), and providing functionalities like HTML export and FTP upload.
    -   **Changes Made**: Initial setup for API routes, implementation of export logic (including HTML serialization of component data), and FTP upload endpoints. Crucially,  was installed and configured for file uploads. Export functionality had a critical bug related to  serialization which was later fixed.

-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**:
    -   **Summary**: The main React component that constitutes the entire landing page builder UI. It manages application state, component rendering, drag-and-drop logic, property editing, and integrates with the backend API.
    -   **Changes Made**: This file underwent the most significant and frequent modifications throughout the development.
        -   **Initial Build**: Setup of the main layout (sidebar, canvas, properties panel), implementation of the glass-morphism aesthetic, and integration of core Shadcn UI components.
        -   **Component Management**: Logic for adding, selecting, updating, and deleting components (Text, Button, Form, Timer, Audio, Video, Logo, AI Chat/Live Chat, Slot Machine, Visitor Data).
        -   **Drag-and-Drop**: , ,  handlers were refined multiple times to ensure smooth dragging, prevent components from getting stuck, and implement anti-stacking with random initial positioning.
        -   **Properties Panel**: Dynamic rendering of component-specific properties (text content, font size, color, border radius, timer settings, audio controls, CTA types, slot machine configuration).
        -   **Export & FTP**: Implementation of , , , and  functions, including dialogs for FTP configuration and export format selection (HTML, JSON, iFrame).
        -   **Background & Effects**: State and logic for background image upload, and controls for image fade, blur, invert, vignette, and the Page Shimmer Effect.
        -   **Dynamic Features**: Integration of Google Fonts, ALL CAPS toggle, logic for different chatbot providers, camera access for Take Photo component, and capturing/displaying visitor IP/location/device.
        -   **Bug Fixes**: Numerous fixes for UI overlaps, property control responsiveness (sliders, toggles), component sticking/layering, and ensuring CTA/Form/Timer components function correctly.

-   **/app/frontend/src/App.css**:
    -   **Summary**: Contains custom CSS rules that complement Tailwind CSS, primarily for specific UI elements, glass-morphism effects, component styling, and layout adjustments.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Styling for , , , .
        -   CSS for glass-morphism effects (e.g., ).
        -   Adjustments to prevent UI text overlap (e.g., increasing properties sidebar width).
        -   Specific theming for the security component () to black/green.
        -   Styling for the page shimmer effect.

<pending_tasks>
Based on the last message from the AI engineer, all reported issues have been fixed, and the application is declared PRODUCTION-READY with 100% functional components!. Therefore, there are no explicitly pending tasks from the previous conversation.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer completed a significant bug-fixing phase, addressing multiple critical functional and UI issues reported by the user. The primary focus was on ensuring all interactive elements and component functionalities were fully operational and visually consistent.

The key aspects of the completed work include:
-   **Component Drag & Drop**: A new, robust drag system (, , ) was implemented, ensuring components move smoothly without getting stuck. An anti-stacking logic was added with random initial positioning (50-350px range) to prevent components from layering in the same spot, and unique IDs with random suffixes were introduced to avoid conflicts.
-   **Property Controls**: All sliders (Font Size, Border Radius, Win Every X Plays), toggles (Autoplay/Loop for audio, ALL CAPS for text), and input fields in the properties panel are now fully functional and display correct values. The properties panel's scrolling and text readability issues were resolved by increasing its width to 340px and improving overflow handling.
-   **CTA Buttons, Forms, and Timer**: These components, which previously got stuck or malfunctioned, are now fully functional and movable. CTA buttons (Request Call, Join Now, Subscribe, Email Me, Take Photo, Waitlist) correctly trigger their intended actions (e.g., phone dialing, email opening, camera capture). The Timer component provides a live countdown and allows easy date/time setting via a DateTime picker.
-   **Security Component UI**: The Visitor Data component received its requested Matrix-style black background with glowing green text, animated effects, and remains fully movable while displaying live IP, location, and device information.
-   **Color Consistency**: All instances of pink/purple colors were removed, maintaining a consistent blue/silver theme throughout the application, with the exception of the newly themed black/green security component.
-   **Audio Component**: Autoplay and Loop switches are now functional with visual indicators, and the music library integration works correctly.

The current state of the APEXONE HIT ONE PAGER is declared to be PRODUCTION-READY with 100% functional components, addressing all recent user complaints regarding stuck elements, non-working controls, UI overlaps, and color inconsistencies.
